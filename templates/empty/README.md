# Grommet empty project

This project has an empty structure that aims to support developers with an
initial application layout without much content.

Remember if you run gulp dev without adding content you will not be able to see
anything in the browser. This is expected because it is an empty project.

To run this application, execute the following commands:

  1. Install NPM modules

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

  2. Start the development server:

    ```
    $ gulp dev
    ```

  3. Create the app distribution to be used by the back-end server

    ```
    $ gulp dist
    ```
